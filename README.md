## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full analytics workflow focused on identifying the key factors affecting **sales**, **profitability**, and **margin performance** in a global retail company (dataset: *Superstore*).

Main business objectives:

✔️ eliminate margin losses caused by excessive discounting  
✔️ optimize logistics and regional operations

## 🔍 Key Insights

| Area | Key Findings |
|------|--------------|
| 🏷️ **Discount Policy** | Mass-discount strategy leads to a negative aggregated margin: **-3% to -8.86%**, depending on calculation method. |
| 🛒 **Product Mix** | Technology category generates the highest margins, yet certain SKUs create **critical losses** (e.g., Cisco TelePresence EX90). |
| 👥 **Customer Segmentation (LTV)** | The **Home Office** segment shows the highest value per customer → requires targeted marketing. |
| 📅 **Seasonality** | Sales peak strongly in **Q4 (Nov–Dec)** → inventory planning should be adapted accordingly. |
| 🌍 **Regional Performance** | Central Region: high sales volume but low profitability → operational cost audit recommended. |
